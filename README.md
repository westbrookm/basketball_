<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Basketball</h1>
<strong>Description</strong>
You're trying to score as many points as you can in under a minute
<p/>
<strong>Inspiration</strong>
I got this idea from arcade games for instance ChuckE.Cheese's. If I have enough time I might try to add in background music sound effects

<strong>Interaction</strong>
So the ball will have some kind of connection possibly copper along with copper being on the net to count the points and gradually get higher, there will or might be some kind of background noise for effects making it more entertaining

<strong>Getting Started</strong>
I will start with interactions, then the timer or the points system on processing.
